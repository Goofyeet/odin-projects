        <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>A nice break from typical hamburgers and much healthier for you.
             These chicken burgers are flavorful, fairly simple to make, and quite
              delicious. I serve these burgers on chive biscuits with tomato chutney.
               Eat to your heart's content!</p>
